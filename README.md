  # User-Story 

  ![homepage](public/assets/images/application.jpg)

  When the application is launched, the user can insert their initial budget amount. As they travel, they can enter in their spending, deposits, and the app will keep track and update their budget. If the user is offline, the budget app will keep functioning and update all the expenses once the app is back online. When offline, the costs are stored in the IndexDB, and the function remains the same with a Service Worker.
